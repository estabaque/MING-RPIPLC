## Configure nodeRED

These variables you can set them in the balenaCloud `Device Variables` tab for the device (or globally for the whole application). If you would like to change your login credentials feel free to update these variables.

Variable Name | Value | Description | Default
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**`USERNAME`** | `STRING` | Define a new username | `balena`
**`PASSWORD`** | `STRING` | Define a new password | `balena`
**`ENCRIPTION_KEY`** | `STRING` | Define a new key to encrypt nodeRED system | `balena`


## Install the RPIPLC node

To run the Industrial Shields nodes on the edge Node-RED get into the Node-RED UI using the port 80 of your local IP address, or alternatively using the balena `Public Device URL`. Then go to the main menu, and click on `Manage palette`. Search for `rpiplc` and you will find the Industrial Shields nodes called `node-red-contrib-rpiplc-node`. And click Install.
